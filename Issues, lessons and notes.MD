# Issues, Lessons and Notes

This is documentation for myself of information I have learnt from this project. The purpose of this documentation is to provide future me potentially useful information.

## Issues I faced:

-   TS2459: Module '"./webgl"' declares 'createRenderer' locally, but it is not exported.
    -   Solution: Restart the webpack serve
-   Webpack:
    -   Accidentally tried getting position of v_BlockPos instead of a_BlockPos
-   Can't access typescript variables in the console browser

## Lessons

-   ReturnType<typeof createRenderer>
-   config: typeof initialConfig

## Notes
